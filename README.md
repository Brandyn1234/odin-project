### What I learned from completing this project:
* Gained a better understanding of functions in Javascript.
* Learned basic DOM manipulation techniques to improve the UI (adding/updating score, displaying text based on win/loss condition, listening for events).
* Linking external javascript files and using defer attribute to place script tag in head of html.
* Basics of css media queries (first attempt at making responsive design).
* More practice styling with CSS.
